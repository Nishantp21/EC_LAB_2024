We have developed a component tester to assess the functionality of ICs, detect defects, and measure resistance and
capacitance. This tool addresses the common challenge of uncertainty in lab work due to faulty ICs. By providing
accurate testing and measurement capabilities, it ensures reliable performance and efficiency in electronics
experimentation. Ultimately, it streamlines troubleshooting processes and enhances productivity in lab
environments. 
Existing solutions like IC tester machines are indeed effective but often come with a high price tag, ranging from
30,000 to 35,000 INR. These machines provide comprehensive testing capabilities but may be cost-prohibitive for
many labs or individuals. Our solution stands out by offering similar functionality for a fraction of the cost, making it
accessible to a wider audience without compromising on quality or accuracy. Its affordability and effectiveness
make it a unique approach to addressing the same problem.
